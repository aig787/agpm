# AGPM - AGentic Package Manager

> ⚠️ **Beta Software**: This project is in active development. Use with caution in production environments.

A Git-based package manager for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, OpenCode, and more) that enables reproducible
installations using lockfile-based dependency management, similar to Cargo.

## Features

- 📦 **Lockfile-based dependency management** - Reproducible installations like Cargo
- 🌐 **Git-based distribution** - Install from any Git repository
- 🚀 **No central registry** - Fully decentralized approach
- 🤖 **Multi-tool support** - Claude Code, OpenCode (alpha), and custom tools
- 🔧 **Six resource types** - Agents, Snippets, Commands, Scripts, Hooks, MCP Servers
- 🎯 **Pattern-based dependencies** - Bulk installation with glob patterns
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** - Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- 🔄 **Transitive dependencies** - Automatic dependency resolution
- 📝 **Markdown templating** - Dynamic content generation with dependency embedding and project file filter (opt-in)

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# macOS/Linux via Homebrew
brew install aig787/homebrew-agpm/agpm-cli

# All platforms via Cargo
cargo install agpm-cli

# Pre-built binaries
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/aig787/agpm/releases/latest/download/agpm-installer.sh | sh
```

See the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for more options and platform-specific instructions.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize a new project
agpm init

# Install dependencies
agpm install

# Check for updates
agpm outdated

# Update dependencies
agpm update

# List installed resources
agpm list
```

### Example Manifest

```toml
# agpm.toml
[sources]
community = "https://github.com/aig787/agpm-community.git"

[agents]
# Claude Code agent (default)
rust-expert = { source = "community", path = "agents/rust-expert.md", version = "v1.0.0" }

# OpenCode agent (alpha)
assistant-oc = { source = "community", path = "agents/assistant.md", version = "v1.0.0", tool = "opencode" }

[snippets]
# Shared snippets (default: .agpm/snippets/)
react-hooks = { source = "community", path = "snippets/react-hooks.md", version = "~1.2.0" }

[commands]
deploy = { source = "community", path = "commands/deploy.md", version = "v2.0.0" }
```

See [docs/examples/](docs/examples/) for more complete examples.

  2 MCP servers configured
```

### Features

- **Active Window**: Shows which resources are currently being processed (5-10 lines)
- **Real-time Updates**: Resources appear and complete in real-time
- **Timing Information**: Each phase shows duration for performance insights
- **Bounded Output**: Terminal stays clean regardless of dependency count
- **Resource Summary**: Final breakdown by resource type (agents, snippets, etc.)
- **Professional Display**: Clean output without emoji prefixes

## Resource Types

AGPM manages six types of resources:

- **Agents** - AI assistant configurations (`.claude/agents/`, `.opencode/agent/`)
- **Snippets** - Reusable code templates (`.agpm/snippets/`)
- **Commands** - Slash commands (`.claude/commands/`, `.opencode/command/`)
- **Scripts** - Executable automation files (`.claude/scripts/`)
- **Hooks** - Event-based automation (→ `.claude/settings.local.json`)
- **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol servers (→ `.mcp.json`, `opencode.json`)

See the [Resources Guide](docs/resources.md) for detailed information.

## Templating Features

AGPM provides powerful template features for dynamic content generation in Markdown resources:

### Dependency Content Embedding

Embed versioned content from AGPM dependencies:

```markdown
---
agpm.templating: true
dependencies:
  snippets:
    - path: snippets/rust-patterns.md
      name: rust_patterns
---
# Rust Code Reviewer

## Shared Patterns
{{ agpm.deps.snippets.rust_patterns.content }}
```

### Project File Filter

Read and embed project-specific files (team docs, company standards):

```markdown
---
agpm.templating: true
---
# Team Agent

## Company Style Guide
{{ 'project/styleguide.md' | content }}

## Team Conventions
{{ 'docs/conventions.txt' | content }}
```

**Key Features**:
- 🔒 **Secure**: Path validation prevents traversal attacks
- 📁 **Text files only**: `.md`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.yaml`
- 🔄 **Recursive**: Project files can reference other project files (10-level depth)
- 🎯 **Combine both**: Use dependency content + project files together

See the [Templating Guide](docs/templating.md) for complete documentation and examples.
