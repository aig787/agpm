## Example 1: Feature Addition Review

### Pull Request: Add User Authentication System

#### Review Report:
```markdown
# Code Review Report

## Summary
This PR implements a JWT-based authentication system with login, logout, and token refresh functionality. The implementation is well-structured but has some security concerns that need addressing.

## üö® High Priority Issues

**auth/jwt_handler.py**
- **Security**: JWT secret is hardcoded. Move to environment variable.
  ```python
  SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"  # Should be from environment
  ```

**auth/middleware.py**
- **Error Handling**: Missing error handling for malformed tokens
  ```python
  try:
      payload = decode_token(token)
  except Exception:
      return jsonify({"error": "Invalid token"}), 401
  ```

## üí° Suggestions

**routes/auth.py**
- Consider adding rate limiting to login endpoint
- Implement refresh token rotation for better security
- Add password complexity requirements

**models/user.py**
- Add email verification field
- Consider adding user roles/permissions

## ‚ú® Nitpicks

**utils/validation.py**
- Function name `validate_email` could be more descriptive
- Add type hints for better documentation

## Overall Assessment
