# Test project for interactive migration
#
# This project simulates an old AGPM installation with:
# - Resources at old paths (not in agpm/ subdirectory)
# - Lockfile pointing to old paths
# - .gitignore with old AGPM managed section
#
# To test interactive migration:
#   cd examples/projects/interactive-migration
#   cargo run -- install
#
# You should see a prompt asking if you want to migrate to the new format.

[sources]
# No remote sources needed for migration testing
