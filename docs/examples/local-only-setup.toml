# Local-Only Setup Example
#
# This example shows AGPM configuration where NOTHING is committed to
# version control. All AGPM resources are kept local to each developer.
#
# Use this when:
# - AGPM configuration is personal (not shared with team)
# - You want complete control over .gitignore management
# - Each developer maintains their own AI resource setup
# - No AGPM files should be tracked in Git
#
# Key behavior:
# - gitignore = false: AGPM won't modify .gitignore
# - Resources NOT COMMITTED: You manually exclude everything
# - Personal workflow: Each developer has their own AGPM setup
#
# IMPORTANT: You MUST manually add these entries to your .gitignore
# to prevent accidental commits:
#
#   # AGPM - keep everything local
#   agpm.toml
#   agpm.lock
#   agpm.private.toml
#   agpm.private.lock
#   .claude/
#   .opencode/
#   .agpm/
#   .mcp.json
#
# Setup options:
# 1. Per-project: Add entries above to your project's .gitignore
# 2. Global: Configure once for all projects:
#      git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
#      # Then add entries above to ~/.gitignore

# Don't let AGPM manage .gitignore - we'll manually exclude everything
gitignore = false
