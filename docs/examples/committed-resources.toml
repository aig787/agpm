# Committed Resources Setup Example
#
# This example shows AGPM configuration where resources ARE COMMITTED to
# version control for team sharing. Resources are part of the codebase.
#
# Use this when:
# - Team members share AI agent configurations via Git
# - Resources should be versioned alongside your code
# - You want manual control over .gitignore (not automatic management)
# - Everyone on the team uses the same AI resources
#
# Key behavior:
# - gitignore = false: AGPM won't modify .gitignore
# - Resources WILL BE COMMITTED: agpm.toml, agpm.lock, .claude/, etc.
# - Team collaboration: AI resources are shared via version control
#
# IMPORTANT: Setting gitignore = false means AGPM won't add entries to
# .gitignore, so resources WILL be committed to Git. This is intentional
# for team sharing scenarios.
#
# For personal customizations that shouldn't be shared:
# - Create agpm.private.toml for personal patches/overrides
# - Manually add to .gitignore:
#     agpm.private.toml
#     agpm.private.lock

# Don't let AGPM manage .gitignore - resources will be committed to Git
gitignore = false
