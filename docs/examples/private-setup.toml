# Private AGPM Setup Example
#
# This example demonstrates a private AGPM configuration where
# no AGPM state is committed to version control.
#
# Key features:
# - gitignore = false: AGPM won't manage .gitignore
# - Local sources: Use relative paths to private repositories
# - agpm.private.toml: Store personal customizations (gitignored)

# Don't manage .gitignore entries
gitignore = false

# IMPORTANT: Add these entries to your global gitignore (~/.gitignore)
# or project-specific gitignore to prevent committing any AGPM state:
#
#   # AGPM state - never commit
#   agpm.toml
#   agpm.lock
#   agpm.private.toml
#   agpm.private.lock
#   .claude/
#   .opencode/
#   .agpm/
#   .mcp.json
#
# For per-project gitignore configuration, create a .gitignore file
# in your project root with the entries above. This ensures
# AGPM state is never accidentally committed to version control.
#
# Alternative: Configure global gitignore for all projects:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
#   # Then add to entries above to ~/.gitignore

# Use local private repositories
[sources]
# Local path to company's internal resource repository
internal = "../company-agpm-resources"

# Local path to personal resource collection
personal = "~/agpm/my-resources"

# Install resources from private sources
[agents]
# Company-specific agents from internal repository
code-reviewer = { source = "internal", path = "agents/code-reviewer.md", version = "v2.1.0" }
security-scanner = { source = "internal", path = "agents/security-scanner.md", version = "v1.5.0" }

# Personal agents from local collection
my-helper = { source = "personal", path = "agents/helper.md", version = "v1.0.0" }

[snippets]
# Company code snippets from internal repository
rust-patterns = { source = "internal", path = "snippets/rust-patterns.md", version = "v3.0.0" }
test-templates = { source = "internal", path = "snippets/test-templates.md", version = "v1.2.0" }

# Personal snippets
my-snippets = { source = "personal", path = "snippets/personal.md", version = "v1.0.0" }

# Custom tool configuration
[default-tools]
# Install all agents to custom directory
agents = "claude-code"

# Override default installation paths
[target]
agents = "tools/ai-agents"
snippets = "code/snippets"
commands = "tools/commands"

# Project-specific variables for templates
[project]
company = "Acme Corp"
team = "Platform Engineering"
code_style = "rust"
test_framework = "cargo test"

# Team-wide patches (committed to version control)
[patch.agents.code-reviewer]
model = "claude-3-sonnet"
temperature = 0.7
max_tokens = 4096

[patch.agents.security-scanner]
severity_threshold = "medium"
exclude_patterns = ["*.test.rs", "tests/"]

# Note: Create agpm.private.toml for personal customizations:
# [patch.agents.my-helper]
# api_key = "${MY_ANTHROPIC_KEY}"
# custom_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant for my specific workflow."
