# User Guide

This guide will help you get started with AGPM and cover common workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git 2.0 or later installed
- Claude Code, OpenCode, or another supported AI coding assistant
- (Optional) Rust toolchain for building from source

### Installation

The quickest way to install AGPM:

```bash
# If you have Rust installed
cargo install agpm

# For latest development version
cargo install --git https://github.com/aig787/agpm.git

# Or download pre-built binaries
# See the Installation Guide for platform-specific instructions
```

### Your First Project

1. **Initialize a new project:**

```bash
agpm init
```

This creates a basic `agpm.toml` file with example dependencies.

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
agpm install
```

This will:
- Clone the required Git repositories to `~/.agpm/cache/`
- Copy resources to your project directories
- Generate a `agpm.lock` file with exact versions

3. **Verify installation:**

```bash
agpm list
```

## Basic Concepts

### Manifest File (agpm.toml)

The manifest defines your project's dependencies:

```toml
[sources]
# Define Git repositories to pull resources from
community = "https://github.com/aig787/agpm-community.git"

[agents]
# Install AI agents - path preservation maintains directory structure
example = { source = "community", path = "agents/example.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
# ‚Üí Installed as: .claude/agents/example.md

nested = { source = "community", path = "agents/ai/helper.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
# ‚Üí Installed as: .claude/agents/ai/helper.md (preserves ai/ subdirectory)
```

See the [Manifest Reference](manifest-reference.md) for a complete field-by-field breakdown and CLI mapping guidance.

### Lockfile (agpm.lock)

The lockfile records exact versions for reproducible installations:
- Generated automatically by `agpm install`
- Should be committed to version control
- Ensures team members get identical versions

#### Lifecycle and Guarantees

- `agpm install` always re-runs dependency resolution using the current manifest and lockfile. If nothing has changed, it writes the same resolved versions and SHAs back to disk‚Äîversions do **not** automatically advance just because you reinstalled.
- Resolution only diverges when the manifest changed, a tag/branch now points somewhere else, or a dependency was missing from the previous lockfile.
- Use `agpm install --no-lock` when you want to verify installs without touching `agpm.lock` (e.g., local experiments).
- Use `agpm install --frozen` in CI or release pipelines to assert that the existing lockfile matches the manifest exactly. The command fails instead of regenerating when staleness is detected.

#### Detecting Staleness

AGPM automatically checks for stale lockfiles during install and via `agpm validate --check-lock`:
- Duplicate entries or source URL drift (security-critical issues)
- Manifest entries missing from the lockfile
- Version/path changes that have not been resolved yet

If any of these occur, rerun `agpm install` (without `--frozen`) to regenerate the lockfile so teammates stay in sync.

### Sources

Sources are Git repositories containing resources:
- Can be public (GitHub, GitLab) or private
- Can be local directories for development
- Authentication handled via global config

## Multi-Tool Support

AGPM supports multiple AI coding assistants from a single manifest using the artifact type system.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alpha Feature**: OpenCode support is currently in alpha. While functional, it may have incomplete features or breaking
> changes in future releases. Use with caution in production environments. Claude Code support is stable and production-ready.

### Supported Tools

- **Claude Code** (default) - Full support for agents, commands, scripts, hooks, MCP servers, and snippets ‚úÖ **Stable**
- **OpenCode** - Support for agents, commands, and MCP servers üöß **Alpha**
- **AGPM** - Shared snippets that can be referenced by multiple tools ‚úÖ **Stable**
- **Custom** - Define your own artifact types via configuration

### Using Multiple Tools

By default, resources install for Claude Code. To target a different tool, add the `type` field:

```toml
[sources]
community = "https://github.com/aig787/agpm-community.git"

[agents]
# Claude Code agent (default - no type field needed)
rust-expert = { source = "community", path = "agents/rust-expert.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
# ‚Üí Installs to .claude/agents/rust-expert.md

# OpenCode agent (explicit type)
rust-expert-oc = { source = "community", path = "agents/rust-expert.md", version = "v1.0.0", type = "opencode" }
# ‚Üí Installs to .opencode/agent/rust-expert.md

[snippets]
# Shared snippet (accessible to both tools)
rust-patterns = { source = "community", path = "snippets/rust-patterns.md", version = "v1.0.0", type = "agpm" }
# ‚Üí Installs to .agpm/snippets/rust-patterns.md
```

### Directory Differences

**Important**: OpenCode uses singular directory names while Claude Code uses plural:

| Resource | Claude Code | OpenCode (Alpha) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Agents | `.claude/agents/` | üöß `.opencode/agent/` |
| Commands | `.claude/commands/` | üöß `.opencode/command/` |
| MCP Servers | `.mcp.json` | üöß `opencode.json` |

AGPM handles this automatically based on the `type` field.

### Multi-Tool Project Example

```toml
[sources]
community = "https://github.com/aig787/agpm-community.git"

[agents]
# Install the same agent for both tools
helper-cc = { source = "community", path = "agents/helper.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
helper-oc = { source = "community", path = "agents/helper.md", version = "v1.0.0", type = "opencode" }  # Alpha

# Rust experts for both
rust-expert-cc = { source = "community", path = "agents/rust-expert.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
rust-expert-oc = { source = "community", path = "agents/rust-expert.md", version = "v1.0.0", type = "opencode" }  # Alpha

[commands]
# Deployment commands for both tools
deploy-cc = { source = "community", path = "commands/deploy.md", version = "v2.0.0" }
deploy-oc = { source = "community", path = "commands/deploy.md", version = "v2.0.0", type = "opencode" }  # Alpha

[mcp-servers]
# MCP servers (automatically routed to correct config file)
filesystem-cc = { source = "community", path = "mcp/filesystem.json", version = "v1.0.0" }
filesystem-oc = { source = "community", path = "mcp/filesystem.json", version = "v1.0.0", type = "opencode" }  # Alpha

[snippets]
# Shared snippets usable by both tools
shared-patterns = { source = "community", path = "snippets/patterns/*.md", version = "v1.0.0", type = "agpm" }
```

### Benefits

- **Unified Management**: One manifest for all your AI assistant resources
- **Consistent Versioning**: Keep all tools synchronized to the same resource versions
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reuse snippets and patterns across tools
- **Easy Migration**: Switch between tools without recreating your resource setup

## Common Workflows

### Adding Dependencies

#### Method 1: Edit agpm.toml directly

```toml
[agents]
my-agent = { source = "community", path = "agents/helper.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
```

Then run:
```bash
agpm install
```

#### Method 2: Use CLI commands

```bash
# Add a source
agpm add source community https://github.com/aig787/agpm-community.git

# Add a dependency
agpm add dep agent community:agents/helper.md --name my-agent
```

### Checking for Updates

Before updating, check what updates are available:

```bash
# Check all dependencies for available updates
agpm outdated

# Check specific dependencies
agpm outdated my-agent other-agent

# Use in CI to fail if updates are available
agpm outdated --check

# Get JSON output for automation
agpm outdated --format json
```

The `outdated` command shows:
- Current version from your lockfile
- Latest available version in the repository
- Compatible updates within your version constraints
- Major updates that would require constraint changes

### Updating Dependencies

Update all dependencies within version constraints:

```bash
agpm update
```

Update specific dependency:

```bash
agpm update my-agent
```

Preview updates without making changes:

```bash
agpm update --dry-run
```

### Working with Local Resources

For development, use local directories:

```toml
[sources]
local = "./my-resources"

[agents]
dev-agent = { source = "local", path = "agents/dev.md" }
```

Or reference files directly:

```toml
[agents]
local-agent = { path = "../agents/my-agent.md" }
```

### Private Repositories

For private repositories, configure authentication globally:

```bash
# Add private source with token
agpm config add-source private "https://oauth2:TOKEN@github.com/org/private.git"
```

Then reference in your manifest:

```toml
[agents]
internal = { source = "private", path = "agents/internal.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
```

## Version Management

### Version Constraints

AGPM supports flexible version constraints:

```toml
# Exact version
agent1 = { source = "community", path = "agents/a1.md", version = "v1.0.0" }

# Compatible updates (1.x.x)
agent2 = { source = "community", path = "agents/a2.md", version = "^1.0.0" }

# Patch updates only (1.0.x)
agent3 = { source = "community", path = "agents/a3.md", version = "~1.0.0" }

# Latest stable
agent4 = { source = "community", path = "agents/a4.md", version = "latest" }
```

### Branch Tracking

For development, track branches:

```toml
[agents]
dev-agent = { source = "community", path = "agents/dev.md", branch = "main" }
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Branches update on each `agpm update`. Use tags for stability.

## Team Collaboration

### Setting Up

1. Create and configure `agpm.toml`
2. Run `agpm install` to generate `agpm.lock`
3. Commit both files to Git:

```bash
git add agpm.toml agpm.lock
git commit -m "Add AGPM dependencies"
```

### Team Member Setup

Team members clone the repository and run:

```bash
# Install exact versions from lockfile
agpm install --frozen
```

### Updating Dependencies

When updating dependencies:

1. Update version constraints in `agpm.toml`
2. Run `agpm update`
3. Test the changes
4. Commit the updated `agpm.lock`

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Install AGPM
  run: cargo install --git https://github.com/aig787/agpm.git

- name: Install dependencies
  run: agpm install --frozen
```

### With Authentication

```yaml
- name: Configure AGPM
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.agpm
    echo '[sources]' > ~/.agpm/config.toml
    echo 'private = "https://oauth2:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/org/private.git"' >> ~/.agpm/config.toml

- name: Install dependencies
  run: agpm install --frozen
```

## Pattern Matching

Install multiple resources using glob patterns. Each matched file preserves its source directory structure:

```toml
[agents]
# All markdown files in agents/ai/ - each preserves its path
# agents/ai/assistant.md ‚Üí .claude/agents/ai/assistant.md
# agents/ai/analyzer.md ‚Üí .claude/agents/ai/analyzer.md
ai-agents = { source = "community", path = "agents/ai/*.md", version = "v1.0.0" }

# All review agents recursively - nested structure maintained
# agents/code/review-expert.md ‚Üí .claude/agents/code/review-expert.md
# agents/security/review-scanner.md ‚Üí .claude/agents/security/review-scanner.md
review-agents = { source = "community", path = "agents/**/review*.md", version = "v1.0.0" }

[snippets]
# All Python snippets - directory structure preserved
# snippets/python/utils.md ‚Üí .claude/agpm/snippets/python/utils.md
# snippets/python/django/models.md ‚Üí .claude/agpm/snippets/python/django/models.md
python = { source = "community", path = "snippets/python/**/*.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
```

During `agpm install`, AGPM expands each glob, installs every concrete match, and records them individually in `agpm.lock` under the pattern dependency. Lockfile entries use the `resource_type/name@resolved_version` format so you can track the exact files that were installed.

> **Tip**: Pair pattern entries with descriptive keys (like `ai-agents`) and review the resolved output with `agpm list` or by inspecting `agpm.lock` to confirm the matches.

## Transitive Dependencies

Resources can declare their own dependencies, and AGPM will automatically resolve the entire dependency tree.

### Declaring Dependencies

**In Markdown files (.md)**, use YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
---
title: My Agent
description: Helper agent with dependencies
dependencies:
  agents:
    - path: agents/utils.md
      version: v1.0.0
  snippets:
    - path: snippets/helpers.md
---

# Agent content here
```

**In JSON files (.json)**, use a top-level field:
```json
{
  "events": ["SessionStart"],
  "type": "command",
  "command": "echo 'Starting'",
  "dependencies": {
    "commands": [
      {"path": "commands/setup.md", "version": "v1.0.0"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Discovery**: When installing resources, AGPM scans their contents for dependency declarations
2. **Graph Building**: All dependencies (direct and transitive) are collected into a dependency graph
3. **Cycle Detection**: Circular dependencies are detected and reported as errors
4. **Topological Ordering**: Dependencies are installed before their dependents
5. **Version Resolution**: Conflicts are automatically resolved using the highest compatible version

### Dependency Inheritance

Transitive dependencies inherit properties from their parent:
- **Source**: Always inherits from the parent resource's source
- **Version**: Defaults to parent's version if not specified

### Example

```toml
# agpm.toml
[sources]
community = "https://github.com/aig787/agpm-community.git"

[commands]
deploy = { source = "community", path = "commands/deploy.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
```

If `deploy.md` declares:
```markdown
---
dependencies:
  agents:
    - path: agents/deploy-helper.md
  snippets:
    - path: snippets/aws-utils.md
      version: v2.0.0
---
```

Running `agpm install` will automatically install:
1. `deploy.md` (direct dependency)
2. `agents/deploy-helper.md` (transitive, inherits v1.0.0)
3. `snippets/aws-utils.md` (transitive, uses v2.0.0)

### Resource-Specific Notes

- **Scripts & hooks**: Transitive scripts inherit the parent's source but still require executable permissions. Hooks declared in metadata merge into `.claude/settings.local.json`; use `target` or `filename` overrides in the manifest if two hooks would collide.
- **MCP servers**: Transitive MCP definitions inherit `command`/`args` from the file itself. Edit the manifest entry if you need to override runtime arguments.
- **Version overrides**: If a downstream resource needs a different version than its parent, specify `version:` in the resource metadata. AGPM will prioritize the explicit value over inheritance.

### Lockfile Tracking

Transitive dependencies are tracked in `agpm.lock`:
```toml
[[commands]]
name = "deploy"
path = "commands/deploy.md"
version = "v1.0.0"
dependencies = [
    "agents/deploy-helper@v1.0.0",
    "snippets/aws-utils@v2.0.0"
]
```

### Conflict Resolution

When multiple resources depend on the same resource, AGPM attempts to converge on a single version:
- Compatible constraints resolve to the highest satisfying tag and the decision is logged in the CLI output.
- Incompatible constraints (`v1` vs `v2` with no overlap) make the install fail with a detailed error.
- Duplicate install paths (for example, two patterns resolving to `.claude/agents/reviewer.md`) also trigger a hard error.

Typical failure output:

```text
Error: Version conflict for agents/helper.md
  requested: v1.0.0 (manifest)
  requested: v2.0.0 (transitive via agents/deploy.md)
  resolution: no compatible tag satisfies both constraints
```

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. Run `agpm validate --resolve --format json` to see the dependency graph AGPM built.
2. If the conflict is transitive, update the declaring resource's metadata to pin a specific `version` or fork the dependency.
3. If it is direct, align your manifest constraints (e.g., bump both to `v2.0.0`) and run `agpm install` to auto-update the lockfile.
4. For duplicate install paths, add `filename` or `target` overrides so the files land in distinct locations.

After making changes, re-run `agpm install` to refresh `agpm.lock`. Use `RUST_LOG=debug` when you need the full resolver trace.

## Resource Organization

### Default Locations

Resources are installed to these default locations, with source directory structure preserved:

- Agents: `.claude/agents/` (e.g., `agents/ai/helper.md` ‚Üí `.claude/agents/ai/helper.md`)
- Snippets: `.claude/agpm/snippets/` (e.g., `snippets/react/hooks.md` ‚Üí `.claude/agpm/snippets/react/hooks.md`)
- Commands: `.claude/commands/` (e.g., `commands/build/deploy.md` ‚Üí `.claude/commands/build/deploy.md`)
- Scripts: `.claude/agpm/scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/ci/test.sh` ‚Üí `.claude/agpm/scripts/ci/test.sh`)
- Hooks: `.claude/agpm/hooks/`
- MCP Servers: `.claude/agpm/mcp-servers/`

**Path Preservation**: The relative directory structure from the source repository is maintained during installation. This means:
- `agents/example.md` ‚Üí `.claude/agents/example.md`
- `agents/ai/code-reviewer.md` ‚Üí `.claude/agents/ai/code-reviewer.md`
- `agents/specialized/rust/expert.md` ‚Üí `.claude/agents/specialized/rust/expert.md`

### Custom Locations

Override defaults in `agpm.toml`:

```toml
[target]
agents = "custom/agents"
snippets = "resources/snippets"
commands = "tools/commands"
```

### Version Control

By default, installed files are gitignored. To commit them:

```toml
[target]
gitignore = false  # Don't create .gitignore
```

## Performance Features

AGPM v0.3.2+ includes significant performance optimizations:

### Centralized Version Resolution
- **Batch processing**: All version constraints resolved in a single operation per repository
- **Automatic deduplication**: Identical version requirements processed only once
- **Minimal Git operations**: Single fetch per repository per command

### SHA-Based Worktree Optimization
- **Maximum reuse**: Multiple dependencies with same commit SHA share one worktree
- **Parallel safety**: Independent worktrees enable conflict-free concurrent operations
- **Smart caching**: Command-instance caching prevents redundant network operations

### Controlling Parallelism
```bash
# Control number of parallel operations (default: max(10, 2 √ó CPU cores))
agpm install --max-parallel 8

# Use all available cores
agpm install --max-parallel 0

# Single-threaded execution for debugging
agpm install --max-parallel 1
```

### Cache Management
```bash
# View cache statistics
agpm cache list

# Clean old cache entries
agpm cache clean

# Bypass cache for fresh installation
agpm install --no-cache
```

### Automatic Artifact Cleanup

AGPM automatically removes old resource files when:
- A dependency is removed from the manifest
- A resource's path changes in the manifest
- A resource is renamed

**Example:**
```toml
# Initial agpm.toml
[agents]
helper = { source = "community", path = "agents/helper.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
# Installed as: .claude/agents/helper.md
```

After updating the path:
```toml
# Updated agpm.toml
[agents]
helper = { source = "community", path = "agents/ai/helper.md", version = "v1.0.0" }
# Now installed as: .claude/agents/ai/helper.md
```

When you run `agpm install`:
1. The old file at `.claude/agents/helper.md` is automatically removed
2. The new file is installed at `.claude/agents/ai/helper.md`
3. Empty parent directories are cleaned up (`.claude/agents/` only if empty)

**Benefits:**
- No manual cleanup required
- Prevents stale files from accumulating
- Maintains clean project structure

## Best Practices

1. **Always commit agpm.lock** for reproducible builds
2. **Use semantic versioning** (`v1.0.0`) instead of branches
3. **Validate before committing**: Run `agpm validate`
4. **Use --frozen in production**: `agpm install --frozen`
5. **Keep secrets in global config**, never in `agpm.toml`
6. **Document custom sources** with comments
7. **Check for outdated dependencies** regularly: `agpm outdated`
8. **Test updates locally** before committing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Manifest not found:**
```bash
agpm init  # Create a new manifest
```

**Version conflicts:**
```bash
agpm validate --resolve  # Check for conflicts
```

**Authentication issues:**
```bash
agpm config list-sources  # Verify source configuration
```

**Lockfile out of sync:**
```bash
agpm install  # Regenerate lockfile
```
