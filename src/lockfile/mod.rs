//! Lockfile management for reproducible installations across environments.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive lockfile functionality for AGPM, similar to Cargo's
//! `Cargo.lock` but designed specifically for managing Claude Code resources (agents,
//! snippets, and commands) from Git repositories. The lockfile ensures that all team members and CI/CD
//! systems install identical versions of dependencies.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The lockfile (`agpm.lock`) is automatically generated from the manifest (`agpm.toml`)
//! during installation and contains exact resolved versions of all dependencies. Unlike
//! the manifest which specifies version constraints, the lockfile pins exact commit hashes
//! and file checksums for reproducibility.
//!
//! ## Key Concepts
//!
//! - **Version Resolution**: Converts version constraints to exact commits
//! - **Dependency Pinning**: Locks all transitive dependencies at specific versions
//! - **Reproducibility**: Guarantees identical installations across environments
//! - **Integrity Verification**: Uses SHA-256 checksums to detect file corruption
//! - **Atomic Operations**: All lockfile updates are atomic to prevent corruption
//!
//! # Lockfile Format Specification
//!
//! The lockfile uses TOML format with the following structure:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # Auto-generated lockfile - DO NOT EDIT
//! version = 1
//!
//! # Source repositories with resolved commits
//! [[sources]]
//! name = "community"                              # Source name from manifest
//! url = "https://github.com/example/repo.git"     # Repository URL
//! commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."                      # Resolved commit hash (40 chars)
//! fetched_at = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"             # Last fetch timestamp (RFC 3339)
//!
//! # Agent resources
//! [[agents]]
//! name = "example-agent"                          # Resource name
//! source = "community"                            # Source name (optional for local)
//! url = "https://github.com/example/repo.git"     # Source URL (optional for local)
//! path = "agents/example.md"                      # Path in source repository
//! version = "v1.0.0"                              # Requested version constraint
//! resolved_commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."             # Resolved commit for this resource
//! checksum = "sha256:abcdef123456..."             # SHA-256 checksum of installed file
//! installed_at = "agents/example-agent.md"        # Installation path (relative to project)
//!
//! # Snippet resources (same structure as agents)
//! [[snippets]]
//! name = "example-snippet"
//! source = "community"
//! path = "snippets/example.md"
//! version = "^1.0"
//! resolved_commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
//! checksum = "sha256:fedcba654321..."
//! installed_at = "snippets/example-snippet.md"
//!
//! # Command resources (same structure as agents)
//! [[commands]]
//! name = "build-command"
//! source = "community"
//! path = "commands/build.md"
//! version = "v1.0.0"
//! resolved_commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
//! checksum = "sha256:123456abcdef..."
//! installed_at = ".claude/commands/build-command.md"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Field Details
//!
//! ### Version Field
//! - **Type**: Integer
//! - **Purpose**: Lockfile format version for future compatibility
//! - **Current**: 1
//!
//! ### Sources Array
//! - **name**: Unique identifier for the source repository
//! - **url**: Full Git repository URL (HTTP/HTTPS/SSH)
//! - **commit**: 40-character SHA-1 commit hash at time of resolution
//! - **`fetched_at`**: ISO 8601 timestamp of last successful fetch
//!
//! ### Resources Arrays (agents/snippets/commands)
//! - **name**: Unique resource identifier within its type
//! - **source**: Source name (omitted for local resources)
//! - **url**: Repository URL (omitted for local resources)  
//! - **path**: Relative path within source repository or filesystem
//! - **version**: Original version constraint from manifest (omitted for local)
//! - **`resolved_commit`**: Exact commit containing this resource (omitted for local)
//! - **checksum**: SHA-256 hash prefixed with "sha256:" for integrity verification
//! - **`installed_at`**: Relative path where resource is installed in project
//!
//! # Relationship to Manifest
//!
//! The lockfile is generated from the manifest (`agpm.toml`) through dependency resolution:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # agpm.toml (manifest)
//! [sources]
//! community = "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
//!
//! [agents]
//! example-agent = { source = "community", path = "agents/example.md", version = "^1.0" }
//! local-agent = { path = "../local/helper.md" }
//! ```
//!
//! During `agpm install`, this becomes:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # agpm.lock (lockfile)
//! version = 1
//!
//! [[sources]]
//! name = "community"
//! url = "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
//! commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
//! fetched_at = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
//!
//! [[agents]]
//! name = "example-agent"
//! source = "community"
//! url = "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
//! path = "agents/example.md"
//! version = "^1.0"
//! resolved_commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
//! checksum = "sha256:abcdef..."
//! installed_at = "agents/example-agent.md"
//!
//! [[agents]]
//! name = "local-agent"
//! path = "../local/helper.md"
//! checksum = "sha256:123abc..."
//! installed_at = "agents/local-agent.md"
//! ```
//!
//! # Version Resolution and Pinning
//!
//! AGPM resolves version constraints to exact commits using Git tags and branches:
//!
//! ## Version Constraint Resolution
//!
//! 1. **Exact versions** (`"v1.2.3"`): Match exact Git tag
//! 2. **Semantic ranges** (`"^1.0"`, `"~1.2"`): Find latest compatible tag
//! 3. **Branch names** (`"main"`, `"develop"`): Use latest commit on branch
//! 4. **Commit hashes** (`"a1b2c3d"`): Use exact commit (must be full 40-char hash)
//!
//! ## Resolution Process
//!
//! 1. **Fetch Repository**: Clone or update source repository cache
//! 2. **Enumerate Tags**: List all Git tags matching semantic version pattern
//! 3. **Apply Constraints**: Filter tags that satisfy version constraint
//! 4. **Select Latest**: Choose highest version within constraint
//! 5. **Resolve Commit**: Map tag to commit hash
//! 6. **Verify Resource**: Ensure resource exists at that commit
//! 7. **Calculate Checksum**: Generate SHA-256 hash of resource content
//! 8. **Record Entry**: Add resolved information to lockfile
//!
//! # Install vs Update Semantics
//!
//! ## Install Behavior
//! - Uses existing lockfile if present (respects pinned versions)
//! - Only resolves dependencies not in lockfile
//! - Preserves existing pins even if newer versions available
//! - Ensures reproducible installations
//!
//! ## Update Behavior  
//! - Ignores existing lockfile constraints
//! - Re-resolves all dependencies against current manifest constraints
//! - Updates to latest compatible versions within constraints
//! - Regenerates entire lockfile
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Install exact versions from lockfile (if available)
//! agpm install
//!
//! # Update to latest within manifest constraints
//! agpm update
//!
//! # Update specific resource
//! agpm update example-agent
//! ```
//!
//! # Checksum Verification
//!
//! AGPM uses SHA-256 checksums to ensure file integrity:
//!
//! ## Checksum Format
//! - **Algorithm**: SHA-256
//! - **Encoding**: Hexadecimal
//! - **Prefix**: "sha256:"
//! - **Example**: "sha256:a665a45920422f9d417e4867efdc4fb8a04a1f3fff1fa07e998e86f7f7a27ae3"
//!
//! ## Verification Process
//! 1. **During Installation**: Calculate checksum of installed file
//! 2. **During Validation**: Compare stored checksum with file content
//! 3. **On Mismatch**: Report corruption and suggest re-installation
//!
//! # Best Practices
//!
//! ## Commit Lockfile to Version Control
//! The lockfile should always be committed to version control:
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Commit both manifest and lockfile together
//! git add agpm.toml agpm.lock
//! git commit -m "Add new agent dependency"
//! ```
//!
//! This ensures all team members get identical dependency versions.
//!
//! ## Don't Edit Lockfile Manually
//! The lockfile is auto-generated and should not be edited manually:
//! - Use `agpm install` to update lockfile from manifest changes
//! - Use `agpm update` to update dependency versions
//! - Delete lockfile and run `agpm install` to regenerate from scratch
//!
//! ## Lockfile Conflicts
//! During Git merges, lockfile conflicts may occur:
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Resolve by regenerating lockfile
//! rm agpm.lock
//! agpm install
//! git add agpm.lock
//! git commit -m "Resolve lockfile conflict"
//! ```
//!
//! # Migration and Upgrades
//!
//! ## Format Version Compatibility
//! AGPM checks lockfile format version and provides clear error messages:
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: Lockfile version 2 is newer than supported version 1.
//! This lockfile was created by a newer version of agpm.
//! Please update agpm to the latest version to use this lockfile.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Upgrading Lockfiles
//! Future format versions will include automatic migration:
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Future: Migrate lockfile to newer format
//! agpm install --migrate-lockfile
//! ```
//!
//! # Comparison with Cargo.lock
//!
//! AGPM's lockfile design is inspired by Cargo but adapted for Git-based resources:
//!
//! | Feature | Cargo.lock | agpm.lock |
//! |---------|------------|-----------|
//! | Format | TOML | TOML |
//! | Versioning | Semantic | Git tags/branches/commits |
//! | Integrity | Checksums | SHA-256 checksums |
//! | Sources | crates.io + git | Git repositories only |
//! | Resources | Crates | Agents + Snippets |
//! | Resolution | Dependency graph | Flat dependency list |
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! The lockfile module provides detailed error messages with actionable suggestions:
//!
//! - **Parse Errors**: TOML syntax issues with fix suggestions
//! - **Version Errors**: Incompatible format versions with upgrade instructions  
//! - **IO Errors**: File system issues with permission/space guidance
//! - **Corruption**: Checksum mismatches with re-installation steps
//!
//! # Cross-Platform Considerations
//!
//! Lockfiles are fully cross-platform compatible:
//! - **Path Separators**: Always use forward slashes in lockfile paths
//! - **Line Endings**: Normalize to LF for consistent checksums
//! - **File Permissions**: Not stored in lockfile (Git handles this)
//! - **Case Sensitivity**: Preserve case from source repositories
//!
//! # Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **Parsing**: O(n) where n is number of locked resources
//! - **Checksum Calculation**: O(m) where m is total file size
//! - **Lookups**: O(n) linear search (suitable for typical dependency counts)
//! - **Atomic Writes**: Single fsync per lockfile update
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! The [`LockFile`] struct is not thread-safe by itself, but the module provides
//! atomic operations for concurrent access:
//! - **File Locking**: Uses OS file locking during atomic writes
//! - **Process Safety**: Multiple agpm instances coordinate via lockfile
//! - **Concurrent Reads**: Safe to read lockfile from multiple threads
