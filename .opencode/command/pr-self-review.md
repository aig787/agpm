## Your task

Perform a comprehensive pull request review for the AGPM project based on the current changes.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly perform the review actions yourself - do NOT attempt to create or submit a pull request. Analyze the changes and generate a review report.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/pr-self-review.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Focus on reviewing the actual changes in the repository
- Do NOT use gh CLI commands to create PRs
