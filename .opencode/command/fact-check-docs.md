## Your task

Fact-check all documentation files against the current codebase implementation.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly perform the fact-checking analysis - read the documentation, examine the code, and identify any discrepancies yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/fact-check-docs.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use Read and Grep tools to examine documentation and code
- Generate a report of any inconsistencies found
