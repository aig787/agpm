description: Create well-formatted git commits following project conventions - supports single or multiple logically grouped commits
---

## Your task

Create well-formatted git commits following project conventions.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly create git commits - analyze the changes, craft appropriate commit messages, and use the git commands to commit them. Do NOT ask for permission or confirmation.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/commit.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use the Bash tool to run git commands directly
- Follow the commit message style from the repository
