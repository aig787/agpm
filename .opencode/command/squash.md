## Your task

Squash commits between two hashes into one, optionally regrouping into logical commits, or restore from a previous squash.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly perform git squash operations - use git commands to rewrite history as requested.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/squash.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use the Bash tool to run git rebase and related commands
- Be careful with force pushes if needed
