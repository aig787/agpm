## Your task

Review changes and update README.md to stay current with implementation.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly update the README.md file - examine the codebase and ensure the documentation accurately reflects the current state.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/update-docs.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use Read and Edit tools to update README.md
- Focus on user-facing changes and installation instructions
