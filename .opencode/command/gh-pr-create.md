## Your task

Automatically create a GitHub pull request with a well-formatted title and description.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly create a pull request - analyze the changes, craft an appropriate title and description, and use the gh CLI to create the PR.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/gh-pr-create.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use the Bash tool to run gh commands directly
- Stage changes if needed before creating the PR
