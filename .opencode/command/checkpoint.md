## Your task

Create or restore Git-based checkpoints for safe AI-assisted editing.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly perform these checkpoint actions - do NOT attempt to execute any external command or script. Implement the checkpoint logic yourself using the available tools.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/checkpoint.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Focus on implementing the checkpoint functionality directly
- Do NOT attempt to run external checkpoint commands
