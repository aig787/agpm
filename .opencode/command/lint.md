## Your task

Run code quality checks including formatting, linting, and documentation.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly perform these quality checks - run the appropriate commands and report the results.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/lint.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use the Bash tool to run cargo fmt, cargo clippy, etc.
- Report any issues found and suggest fixes
