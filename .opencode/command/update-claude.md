## Your task

Review changes and update CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md to reflect current architecture and implementation.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly update these documentation files - analyze the codebase and ensure the documentation accurately reflects the current state.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/update-claude.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use Read and Edit tools to update documentation
- Focus on architectural changes and new features
