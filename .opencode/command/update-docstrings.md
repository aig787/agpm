## Your task

Review code changes and ensure all related documentation is accurate and up-to-date.

**IMPORTANT**: You are being asked to directly update docstrings and documentation - examine the code changes and add/update documentation as needed.

**IMPORTANT**: This command extends the shared base prompt. Read the complete command logic from:
- `.agpm/snippets/commands/update-docstrings.md`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for OpenCode
- Adjust any tool-specific syntax as needed
- Use Read and Edit tools to add/update docstrings
- Focus on public APIs and complex functions
