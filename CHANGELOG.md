* feat(resolver): add centralized version resolver for SHA-based caching

Introduces VersionResolver for efficient two-phase resolution strategy:
- Collection phase gathers all unique (source, version) pairs
- Resolution phase batch resolves versions to SHAs
- Enables SHA-based worktree deduplication
- Supports semver constraint resolution
- Minimizes Git operations through batching

Refactors cache module to use SHA-based worktrees:
- One worktree per unique commit (not per version)
- Automatic deduplication when multiple refs point to same commit
- WorktreeState enum tracks creation status (Pending/Ready)
- Per-worktree locking for parallel operations

- Improved CLI module structure and command organization
- Streamlined config management with validation
- Optimized Git operations with better test coverage
- Refactored installer to use new VersionResolver
- Simplified source and manifest handling

Key improvements:
- Reduced code duplication across modules
- Better separation of concerns
- More consistent error messages
- Improved test coverage for edge cases
