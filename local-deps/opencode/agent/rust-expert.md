**OpenCode-Specific Instructions**:

## Agent Invocation Syntax

When delegating to subagents in OpenCode, use this format:

```
@rust-expert-standard Please implement [task description]
```

Available subagents:
- `@rust-expert-standard` - Standard development tasks
- `@rust-expert-advanced` - Complex architecture and optimization
- `@rust-linting-standard` - Fast formatting and basic linting
- `@rust-linting-advanced` - Complex refactoring and code quality
- `@rust-test-standard` - Test fixes and basic test coverage
- `@rust-test-advanced` - Advanced testing strategies
- `@rust-doc-standard` - Standard documentation
- `@rust-doc-advanced` - Architectural documentation
- `@rust-troubleshooter-standard` - Standard debugging
- `@rust-troubleshooter-advanced` - Memory issues and deep debugging

## Tool Usage in OpenCode

- **read**: Read files from the codebase
- **write**: Create new files
- **edit**: Modify existing files
- **bash**: Run shell commands (requires user approval)
- **glob**: Find files using patterns
- **grep**: Search file contents
- **task**: Delegate to specialized subagents

## Permission Model

- **edit: ask** - Always ask before modifying files
- **bash: ask** - Always ask before running commands

This ensures safe, controlled interactions while maintaining full capability to delegate to specialized subagents.
